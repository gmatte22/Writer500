# Writer500 Help

## What is Writer500?
Writer500 is a simple, distraction-reduced writing app designed around a word-limit workflow (default: 500 words). Write in a clean editor, keep an eye on your word count, and adjust the interface to match your writing style.

## Quick start

1. Create a new document (File → New).
2. Start writing.
3. Watch the word count and word limit indicators.
4. Use Focus Mode when you want fewer visual distractions.

## Word limit

- The default limit is **500 words**.
- You can change the word limit in the app’s UI.
- Use “Reset Defaults (16pt / 500 words)” if you want to return to the baseline settings.

## Focus Mode
Focus Mode is meant to reduce distractions while you write.

- Toggle it from **View → Enable/Disable Focus Mode**
- Shortcut: **Command-Shift-F**
- When enabled, the UI de-emphasizes the bottom bar (and anything else wired into focus mode).

## Font size controls
You can adjust the editor font size anytime:

- Increase font size: **Command-+**
- Decrease font size: **Command--**
- Reset font size to 16pt: **Command-0**

## Reset defaults
If you want to quickly return to the standard writing setup:

- Reset Defaults (16pt / 500 words): **Command-Shift-R**

## About and version info
Use **Writer500 → About Writer500** to see version/build info and other app details.

## Where files live
Writer500 is document-based:

- You choose where to save files (iCloud Drive, local folders, etc.)
- Documents can be opened again later from Finder or File → Open.

## Tips

- For a daily writing workflow, create a folder for entries and use one document per day/session.
- For strict limits, set your word limit before you begin, then write until you hit it.
